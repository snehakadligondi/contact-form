# Project Overview  

This project is part of my Web Development Internship Task.  
I built a Contact Form using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with client-side validation.  

- Users must enter **Name, Email, and Message**.  
- JavaScript checks for **empty fields** and **valid email format** using regex.  
- Error messages are shown if inputs are invalid.  
- On successful validation, the user is redirected to a **success page (success.html)**.
